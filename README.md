# Usage

```javascript

// Start OTP functionality
otp.startOTPTimer(new Date().getTime());

// Generate OTP for user1
const user1OTP = otp.generateOTP('user1', 5);
console.log('Generated OTP for user1 is:', user1OTP);

// Generate OTP for user2
const user2OTP = otp.generateOTP('user2', 5);
console.log('Generated OTP for user2 is:', user2OTP);

otp.validateOTP('user2', user2OTP); 

```

# Functions Description
## startOTPTimer(currentTime)
This function starts the OTP functionality in the program. It only requires time at which the functionality to begin. OTPs will be verified correctly if this function is called before generating any OTP. Its good to start the OTP functionality using the following line
```javascript
otp.startOTPTimer(new Date().getTime());
```

## otp.generateOTP(uniqueIndentifierOfUser, expirayTimeInMinutes)
This function generates and returns the OTP against the unique identifier of the user/customer. Its first parameter is the identifier and send parameter is the amount of time (in minutes) for which we want to generate OTP.

## otp.validateOTP(uniqueIndentifierOfUser, OTP);
This function validates the OTP generated against the customer/user. It returns `true` if the correct OTP is passed as send parameter with in the expiray time, allocated while creating the OTP. If the time is expired and/or incorrect OTP is passed, then `false` is returned.

# Benefits
* No database is required.
* OTP will be created only when it is necessary.
* OTP will be removed from the memory (RAM) when its time is expired.
* Efficient and fast because no read/write operation is performed on the disk.
